Do you ever find yourself putting things off, because you're not sure if they'll be good enough? I've definitely been there before. To battle this I decided to start writing articles and share them in this blog. I believe this will help me overcome my fear of sharing my work even though it probably won't be perfect. 

Warm welcome to my first blog post article on the topic of perfectionism and my experience dealing with it! Hope you are going to learn something new :)


## What is perfectionism?
---

First things first - what exactly do I mean by perfectionism? Seemingly simple term, which has quite some different symptoms. Some of them are:
- not being able to enjoy your accomplishment
- procrastination (for example due to fear of failure)
- being self-critical and critical to others
- experiencing difficulty in taking decisions
- not being able to handle positive feedback well
As a bonus I will provide a few tips on how to address some of those symptoms, so you might want to read until the end.

To give you a first-hand example. This is the third time I am starting over to write this article (and  probably it still won't be good enough :D ). Given you are reading it now it means I have overcome my fears - and if I can do it, you can do it too!


## Perfectionism as a driving force?
---

Have you ever thought about the positive side of perfectionism? Despite its downsides, perfectionism can lead to some incredible results. Freddie Mercury, the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen, is famous for his passion and perfectionism. For example, in the movie "Bohemian Rhapsody", there is an episode where the British band is recording the song "Bohemian Rhapsody". Freddie is demanding the best from his colleagues until they are completely exhausted, but the end result is a song known world wide, which was absolutely revolutional for its time. What is interesting though is that Freddie had a vision and he knew how much he needed to push until he reached his goal.


## Finding the balance
---

Exactly this sense of knowing when something is good enough is essential to find the balance. In my opinion, it is completely acceptable to rework an article, for example, in order to make it better, or to invest more time to gather information before taking a decision. The problem comes when you are finding yourself reworking the articles hundred times, because it is never good enough. Or you never feel confident, because there is always so much more information, which you don't know yet.

My theory is that I should be able to use perfectionism as a tool to give my best and produce the best results I am possible of. However, this should go hand in hand with a strong intuition of when something is good enough. This is important to be able to find the balance, because otherwise it could be that trying to perfect things does more harm than good.

For example, I acknowledge that more experienced people will have a lot of improvement points for this article, but it is to the best of my abilities at this point of time and I am happy with the result. I will definitely try to develop and become better, but I believe that practice makes perfect, so I will just keep going.


## Bonus tips
---


As promised here are a few tips on dealing with perfectionism. First step is creating awareness. Start noticing the situations in which you are unable to take decision, or if you are being too hard on yourself. If those situations are happening really often, maybe it is about time to do exercise some positive thinking and more concretely:
- notice and celebrate the small accomplishments - each big success is dependent on all the small ones before that. You can win a tournament, only if you win all the games leading to it
- set a deadline for taking decisions - some issues require an extensive research, but in the end only the result counts. One can never be too sure in success, thus be a realist and notice when you know enough to take action
- learn to accept and give compliments - compliments don't mean one has achieved everything and there is no point in developing further. On the contrary, use it as an acknowledgment of your hard work so far and use it as a motivation



Thank you for your time and reading this article. I hope you were able to draw some inspiration.
